# Time Series Forecasting of Major Oilseed Crops in Maharashtra

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the production of major oilseed crops in Maharashtra using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Oilseed production varies significantly due to climatic and regional factors. Traditional forecasting models may not fully capture complex production patterns, creating the need for advanced analytical approaches.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical trends of oilseed production
- Apply time series and machine learning models
- Compare model performance using accuracy metrics

## Dataset
- Source: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of Maharashtra
- Period: 1998–2022
- Variables: Year, District, Crop, Area, Production, Yield

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Stationarity testing (ADF Test)
- ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing
- LSTM and Prophet
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Random Forest and XGBoost for yield prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost

## Results
- LSTM captured nonlinear trends effectively
- XGBoost achieved high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.90)
- Production and area were key predictors of yield

## Conclusion
The combination of statistical and machine learning models provides reliable forecasts and valuable insights for agricultural planning.
